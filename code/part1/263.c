/* Fill in code for the following C functions. Function srl performs a logical right
shift using an arithmetic right shift (given by value xsra), followed by other oper-
ations not including right shifts or division. Function sra performs an arithmetic
right shift using a logical right shift (given by value xsrl), followed by other
operations not including right shifts or division. You may use the computation
8*sizeof(int) to determine w, the number of bits in data type int. The shift
amount k can range from 0 to w âˆ’ 1.*/
