* Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) Parallelism
At the lowest level, many modern processors have special hardware that allows
a single instruction to cause multiple operations to be performed in parallel,
a mode known as single-instruction, multiple-data, or “SIMD” parallelism. For
example, recent generations of Intel and AMD processors have instructions that
can add four pairs of single-precision ﬂoating-point numbers (C data type float)
in parallel.
These SIMD instructions are provided mostly to speed up applications that
process image, sound, and video data. Although some compilers attempt to auto-
matically extract SIMD parallelism from C programs, a more reliable method is to
write programs using special vector data types supported in compilers such as gcc.
We describe this style of programming in Web Aside opt:simd, as a supplement to
the more general presentation on program optimization found in Chapter 5.
