* Files
A ﬁle is a sequence of bytes, nothing more and nothing less. Every I/O device,
including disks, keyboards, displays, and even networks, is modeled as a ﬁle. All
input and output in the system is performed by reading and writing ﬁles, using a
small set of system calls known as Unix I/O.
This simple and elegant notion of a ﬁle is nonetheless very powerful because
it provides applications with a uniform view of all of the varied I/O devices that
might be contained in the system. For example, application programmers who
manipulate the contents of a disk ﬁle are blissfully unaware of the speciﬁc disk
technology. Further, the same program will run on different systems that use
different disk technologies. You will learn about Unix I/O in Chapter 10.
